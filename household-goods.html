          <h4>Cost accuracy is vital to the proper planning and management of all successful international relocation programs. Kinetix International provides an invoice auditing process that actually begins with the pre-move survey and is completed upon the delivery and termination of all service requirements. International moving is unique in that there is no universal tariff which dictates the maximum cost of all move related services. Kinetix negotiates favorable rates for all origin, transportation and destination services with pre-qualified service providers world-wide. Our team of specialists audits each service invoice for policy adherence, estimate accuracy, risk management, compliance with international rates and bottom-line accuracy. Our valued clients know that Kinetix is fully accountable for invoice accuracy and cost sensitivity.</h4>
